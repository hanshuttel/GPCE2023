%% For managing citations, it is recommended to use bibliography
%% files in BibTeX format.
%%
%% You can then either use BibTeX with the ACM-Reference-Format style,
%% or BibLaTeX with the acmnumeric or acmauthoryear sytles, that include
%% support for advanced citation of software artefact from the
%% biblatex-software package, also separately available on CTAN.
%%
%% Look at the sample-*-biblatex.tex files for templates showcasing
%% the biblatex styles.
%%

%%
%% The majority of ACM publications use numbered citations and
%% references.  The command \citestyle{authoryear} switches to the
%% "author year" style.
%%
%% If you are preparing content for an event
%% sponsored by ACM SIGGRAPH, you must use the "author year" style of
%% citations and references.
%% Uncommenting
%% the next command will enable that style.

%% The "author" command and its associated commands are used to define

\section{Response}

\subsection{Review \#58A}

\begin{itemize}
\item \reviewer{L76: I see that Andersen et al. had to extend an
    existing editor calculus with let expressions, but I don't see how
    it is related to the previous sentence. Did they write the type
    safety proof from scratch?}
  \response{Some of the type safety proof had
  to be redone -- because of the presence of let-expressions
  in the underlying language and because of parametric
  polymorphism. The addition of a copy/paste primitive in the editor
  calculus was the cause of other revisions. }
\item \reviewer{L80: I could not figure out what "original work"
    refers to.}
  \response{This refers to the Cornell Program Synthesizer mentioned
    in lines 32-33.}
\item \reviewer{L91: I do not see any discussion of higher-order
    abstract syntax in the subsequent sections.}
\response{Indeed. We will rephrase this -- we simply take inspiration from
  this approach to representing abstract syntax.}
\item \reviewer{Example 2.1: Please explain what $s$ and $e$
    represent, and what the notation $e.s$ means. Also, I think the
    term "sort" is not used in the standard way.}
  \response{$s$ is a metavariable for "scoped expressions'' and $e$ is
  a metavariable for "simple expressions''. We will add this
  explanation. The notation $(e)s$ is the arity of the term constructor
  for scoped expressions that are simple expressions: it takes an $e$
  and creates an $s$.

Our presentation of abstract syntax and the terminology and notation
(includion the notions of sorts and
arities) closely follows that of Harper \cite{harper_foundations}, as
mentioned at the start of Section 2. We can elaborate on this approach
at that point in the text.}
\item \reviewer{Section 2.2: Please explain what each syntactic form
    represents.}
  \response{Editor expressions $E$ represent operations on abstract
    binding trees $a$. This has already been explained in
    Subsection 2.1.1. But indeed a short explanation of editor
    expressions in Section 2.1.1 is called for. It is:

    \begin{itemize}
    \item $\pi$ denote navigation actions that lets the cursor move
      down the abt ($\text{child} \; n$ and $\text{parent} $) and
      substitution actions that replace the subtree pointed to by the
      cursor by the syntactic operator $o$.
    \item Expressions $\pi.E$ denote performing $\pi$ and continuing
      as $E$. $\phi \Rightarrow E_1|E_2$ is a conditional expression whose
      continuation depends on the condition $\phi$. $E_1 \ggg E_2$ is
      sequential composition. $\text{rec}\;x.E$ is a recursive
      expression; occurrences of $x$ in $E$ are recursive
      calls. $\text{nil}$ is the empty editor expression.
    \end{itemize}

    We will add this explanation to Section 2.1.1.}
  
\item \reviewer{L174: It is not very clear what the authors mean by
    "encapsulated by the cursor".}
  \response{The cursor points to the root a subtree of the abt being
    edited, so the abt $a$ can be written as a cursor context $C[a_1]$
    whenever the cursor is at the root of the subtree $a_1$. See also
    the end of Section 2.1.2.}
